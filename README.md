# Stony Brook Robot Design Team Internal Robotics Competition 2017

# Introduction

The objective of teams in the Stony Brook Robot Design Team Internal Robotics Competition 2017 is to develop a robot capable of remote control and autonomous operation. The robot has to navigate an arena containing three levels and a hidden (autonomous-only) level to collect blocks of varying shapes to be dropped off of goal areas of each of the three levels to gain points.
